# nernar.github.io/api

Inner Core, Core Engine and Horizon documentation implemented in one place. Make it simple, keep it clean. This site powered by GitHub Pages, built with :heart: and Typedoc.

## Setting up

+ [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above (which can be checked by running `node -v`). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed.
  + When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

```shell
npm install && npm run typedoc
```

## API Reference

New era of Core Engine documentation, generated into single webpage like everything here. Forked from [mineprogramming/innercore-docs](https://github.com/mineprogramming/innercore-docs). See [LICENSE](./LICENSE) for licensing information about this portion of the documentation.

You also can download [core-engine.d.ts](https://nernar.github.io/core-engine.d.ts) directly.

## Contribution

Request PRs for `master` branch, *NEVER* commit to `deploy`. Typedoc should be built successfully to being reviewed, your changes may also require some additional tunings before merging.
